# About Me

## From Curiosity to Code

My journey into technology started at a young age. Growing up, I was always surrounded by it—my dad, an SEO specialist, ran his own agency, and I naturally became immersed in the digital world. When it came time to choose a path in college, I pursued Business Technology at Arizona State University, believing I had a solid grasp of tech but wanted to understand its application in business.

Everything changed when I took a software engineering elective. Writing my first lines of HTML and CSS and seeing them render in a browser ignited something in me. That curiosity quickly turned into an obsession—I spent late nights diving into JavaScript, React, databases, and full-stack development. What started as a simple class became a defining moment in my career, leading me to where I am today: a Senior Software Engineer building applications across the entire stack.

## What I Do

I specialize in React and TypeScript, leveraging my expertise to create scalable, high-performance applications. My frontend knowledge extends beyond just coding—I focus on user experience, accessibility, and performance optimization to ensure that the products I build are not only functional but also intuitive and efficient.

On the backend, I work extensively with ASP.NET (C#), PostgreSQL, and containerized environments (WSL, Podman), allowing me to build and manage complex systems that power enterprise applications. Whether it's freelance websites, ecommerce platforms, or large-scale government applications, I take pride in writing clean, maintainable code that makes an impact.

## My Problem-Solving Philosophy

I approach engineering like a well-structured book—each problem is a chapter that needs a clear beginning, middle, and end. Rather than getting lost in complexity, I break problems down into structured outlines, ensuring that I stay focused and efficient. This method allows me to work through challenges logically while also providing clear estimations for stakeholders.

## Industries & Impact

I've had the opportunity to work on a diverse range of projects, from small business websites to enterprise-level government platforms. My most meaningful contributions have been in:

- **Ecommerce & SEO**: Helping businesses scale through improved page speed, SEO rankings, lead generation, and conversion optimization.
- **Enterprise Solutions**: Developing large-scale platforms for government health services, empowering scientists, geneticists, and researchers with tools to combat global health crises.
- **Small Business Growth**: Providing digital transformation strategies for mom-and-pop businesses that previously lacked an online presence.

## Vision & The Future of Tech

I'm always looking ahead. My short-term goal is to become a well-rounded full-stack engineer with expertise across frontend, backend, and DevOps. Long term, I see two paths:

1. Launching my own SaaS product or consulting agency—leveraging my skills to build something from the ground up.
2. Stepping into tech leadership, whether as a CTO or department head, helping shape the future of engineering teams.

## Why AI is a Game-Changer

I firmly believe that AI is reshaping software development—not replacing engineers, but enhancing productivity and accelerating innovation. I use AI daily for research, debugging, and automating repetitive tasks, and I’m excited to see how these tools will continue to evolve. The barrier to entry in tech has never been lower, and I welcome the wave of innovation that AI is bringing to the industry.

## Beyond the Screen

When I’m not coding, I’m probably:

- Spending time with my wife, Amy, and our two dogs, Donnie and Rocco (my unofficial pair-programming partners).
- Watching Philadelphia sports—I’ve been a die-hard Eagles fan since birth. Go Birds!
- Training in my home gym, one of my best investments yet.
